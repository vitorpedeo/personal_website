Yet **another developer blog**. Yes, I know that internet is flooded with blogs of this nature, and when I was thinking about the idea, I still didn't have a real motivation to build it. However, after finishing it, I discovered that I really need a way to register my evolution on the tech world. So, this blog has one big objective: **record my progress**.

Apart from the big objective, I want my blog to **help other people too**. Maybe the problem I solved today could be someone else's trouble tomorrow.

I'm really motivated to continue my blog, and I hope that you enjoy my future posts. See you!
